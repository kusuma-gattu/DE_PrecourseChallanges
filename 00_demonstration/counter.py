"""
This is a demonstration problem to help you learn how to use `pytest`.

The (not very useful) function `count_to_two` should count to two, but is
going wrong. To see it
fail its tests, from the command line, type:

pytest -vvv 00_demonstration/counter.py

Then fix the code by changing the 1 on line 17 to 2.

Then run pytest using the same command and you should see all the tests pass.
