"""
add_bread is a function that takes a dictionary describing a `person`
and a string of their favourite bread, and returns that object with a
new property (`fave_bread`) set to a value of their favourite bread.

Unfortunately, it looks like the function has a couple of issues with
the way it's written.

Can you work out what needs changing to make the function pass all the tests?
